## Code of Conduct
### Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment 
include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic 
address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a 
professional setting.

### Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable 
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in 
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or 
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions 
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or 
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, 
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces 
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of 
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail 
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an 
appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a 
project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Contributing Code
### Reporting Bug
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for core4. Following 
these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, 
reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports:
- Please check this list of current open issues(link) as you might find out that 
you don't need to create one.
- Only open an issue if no other issue is addressing the same problem. 
If the bug still persists after the issue has been marked as "fixed", 
please open a new one containing a link to the original.
- Try reproducing the bug on a freshly configured machine with upstream code.
(Please do not report bugs that may be caused by customized code or a customized
operating system.)

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. 

How Do I Submit A Bug Report?

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers 
reproduce the problem:
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem as detailed as possible.
- Include configuration/environment information necessary to reproduce.
- Include any files or other resources uses in your example.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see.
- Describe the behavior you observed after triggering the bug and describe 
in detail how this differs from your expectation.

Use the form below to reporting a bug:
```sh
Title of the issue:

What necessary information is needed to reproduce (configuration/environment)?

What steps will reproduce the issue?

What is the expected result?

What happens instead?

```

### Suggesting Enhancements
This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for core4, 
including completely new features and minor improvements to existing 
functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community 
understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check this list (link) as you 
might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an 
enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible.


How Do I Submit A Enhancement Suggestion?
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the enhancement to identify the 
suggestion.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many 
details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the enhancement.

Use the form below to submit enhancement suggestion:
```sh
Title of the suggested enhancement:

Description of the suggested enhancement:

What is the expected result/behavior?

```

### Pull Request Guidelines
The process described here has several goals:
- Maintain core4 quality.
- Fix issues that are important to users.
- Engage the community in working towards the best possible core4.
- Enable a sustainable system for core4's maintainers to review contributions.

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the 
maintainers:
 1. Follow all instructions in the [template](#appendix).
 2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides).
 3. Before submitting a pull request:
    - create or extend suitable tests.
    - ensure that all tests run successfully. Further information how to run 
    the tests can be found here: [README](README.md).
    - create or update the documentation.
 
While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull 
request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design 
work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be accepted.

## Styleguides
### Git Commit Styleguides
Git Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- The commit message should reference the issue number, e.g. 
("[#18882]:bug: Fix scroll").
- Start a commit message with an applicable title:
    - :**bug**: when fixing a bug.
    - :**new**: when add a enhancements (new features and minor improvements).
    - :**remove**: when removing code or files.
    - :**test**: when adding/editing tests.
    - :**style**: when improving the format/structure of the code.
    - :**doc**: when adding/fixing documentation.

### Python Styleguide
Use the style guidelines defined within [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). 
PEP8 is big, constantly evolving and certainly worth reading. The main 
guidelines each core4 contributor should follow are summarised below:

* Use four whitespaces, no tabulators, with a maximum line length of 79 chars.
* Separate classes by two blank lines, functions and methods by one blank line
* Put one space around variable assignments (e.g. ``x = 1``) but do not put
  spaces around list indexes, function calls or keyword assignments (e.g.
  ``func(a=1, b=2)``). 
* Specify functions, variables and attributes in lower case using underscores to
 separate terms.
* Preceed protected attributes with a leading underscore.
* Preceed Private attributes with double leading underscore.
* Use CamelCase for classes and exceptions.
* Write Constants using upper case.
* Use ``self`` for instance methods, ``cls`` for class methods.
* Always put import statements at the top of the file.
* Always use absolute imports, avoid using relative imports.
* Use following import order: standard library modules, third
  party modules, core4 modules.
* Write documentation for every module: explain the contents of the module 
  and any important classes or functions.
* Write documentation for every class: explain behavior, important 
  attributes, subclass behavior.
* Write documentation for every non-private function, list and explain every 
  argument and return value.

These guidelines are based on [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) 
and heavily influenced by Brett Slatkin's [Effective Python - 59 Specific Ways 
to Write Better Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-python-59/9780134034416/).

Shebang line:
- All core4 modules must not provide a shebang line. For actual scripts located 
in ./scripts the correct shebang line is:
```sh
#!/usr/bin/env python3.5
``` 

### Documentation Styleguide
- Use [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) for building the documentation. 
Further information can be found here: [README](README.md).
- Headline hierarchy should be:
```sh   
#######
level 1
#######
    
level 2
=======
    
level 3
-------
```
